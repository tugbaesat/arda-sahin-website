            I am currently a Ph.D. candidate specializing in Geotechnical
            Earthquake Engineering at UCLA, where I am deeply engaged in
            research focused on liquefaction susceptibility and cyclic strength
            of fine-grained soils. During my Masterâ€™s studies, I have focused on
            liquefaction triggering of gravelly soils. Prior to my academic
            studies, I gained professional experience as a Geotechnical Design
            Engineer.

            Beyond my research and professional endeavors, I am passionate about
            teaching and mentoring the next generation of engineers. I have
            served as a teaching assistant for several courses, providing
            guidance and support to students. I actively participate in industry
            conferences and workshops to stay updated with the latest
            advancements in geotechnical engineering and to network with fellow
            professionals and researchers.
